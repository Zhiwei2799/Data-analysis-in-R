Datasets Analysis in R

Description:

This project aims to analyze various datasets from Kaggle or other places for the purpose of gaining insights into different aspects of the data, as well as 
honing my R coding skills through the process of data analysis. The project will continuously be updated by adding new and interesting datasets from Kaggle or 
other sources, and analyzing them using R.

Datasets:

[Netflix movies and TV shows dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows): This dataset comprises a comprehensive list of movies and 
TV shows that are currently or have been previously available on Netflix, including details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, and duration, etc

Goal: 

1. Visualize the number of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
2. Visualize the number of movies and TV shows for each rating.
3. Visualize the number of movies produced by each country using a world map plot in ggplot2.

Requirements:

The following R packages and versions:

1. tidyverse version:	1.3.2
2. skimr version:	2.1.5
3. ggplot2 version:	3.4.0

Datasets:

[Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv): this dataset comprises 1,338 rows and 7 variables such as age, sex, bmi, number of children, smoker status, region and charges for insurance. The target variable is the cost of insurance claims. 

Goal:
1. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on Insurance Dataset.
2. Forcast insurance costs 

Requirement:

The following R packages and versions:

1. tidyverse version:	1.3.2
2. skimr version:	2.1.5
3. ggplot2 version:	3.4.0
4. car  version: 	3.1-1
5. MASS version: 	7.3-58.2
6. GGally version: 2.1.2
7. RandomForest version: 4.7-1.1
8. Caret version: 6.0-93
